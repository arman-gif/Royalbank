Project Title: Online Bank Management System
In the rapidly evolving landscape of banking and finance, there is a growing need for efficient and secure online 
banking systems. Traditional banking methods are becoming outdated, and customers expect seamless and userfriendly digital experiences. The existing online banking systems often lack advanced features, security measures, 
and user-centric designs. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a comprehensive Online Bank Management 
System that addresses these challenges and provides a modern, secure, and user-friendly platform for both 
customers and bank administrators.
